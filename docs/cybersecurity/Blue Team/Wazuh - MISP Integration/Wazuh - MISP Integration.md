## 1. Executive Summary
This report documents the current status, configuration, and technical progress made in integrating MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) with Wazuh and Graylog. The integration aims to enrich Wazuh alerts using threat intelligence from MISP, enabling faster detection of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). This stack also leverages Graylog to enhance log visualization, normalization, and long-term storage.

---

## 2. Integration Architecture Overview
The integration is composed of the following components:
- **Wazuh Manager**: Collects and processes security logs from agents.
- **MISP**: Provides threat intelligence (IoCs) via its RESTful API.
- **Graylog**: Parses and stores enriched alerts, supports visualization and custom pipelines.
- **custom-misp.py**: A Python integration script executed by Wazuh Manager when a specific rule is triggered.

**Why These Components:**
- Wazuh provides scalable agent-based security monitoring.
- MISP enables correlation of event data with up-to-date threat intelligence.
- Graylog enhances log analysis and dashboard visibility, especially when scaling multiple sources.

## 3. Tools and Components
| Component        | Purpose                                                | Current Status              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Wazuh Manager    | Analyzes endpoint logs and triggers integration events | Installed and working       |
| Wazuh Agent      | Captures logs (Sysmon on Windows)                      | Active and reporting        |
| MISP (Docker)    | Centralized threat intel sharing platform              | Successfully deployed       |
| Graylog          | Log normalization, indexing, and visual analysis       | Integrated and operational  |
| custom-misp.py   | Script for querying MISP and enriching alerts          | Operational and enhanced    |

**Why These Tools:**
- Wazuh's flexibility supports fine-grained custom rule logic needed for real-time IoC correlation.
- Dockerized MISP setup simplifies portability and version control for team replication.
- Graylog enables full text search and enrichment pipelines crucial for alert triage and investigation.

## 4. Configuration & Implementation Steps

### 4.1 Wazuh Agent & Manager Setup
Wazuh manager acts as the central processing point for Sysmon events and executes MISP enrichment.
- Installed Wazuh Manager on Ubuntu VM
- Confirmed receipt of Sysmon logs from Windows and linux agents using sysmonforlinux and packetbeat at the linux endpoint. 
- Enabled JSON alert format for integration (required for MISP script parsing)
- Enabled password-based agent authentication for secure connectivity

### 4.2 MISP Deployment (via Docker)
Docker simplifies updates and isolated configuration for MISP and its dependencies.
- Deployed using Docker Compose
- Created admin user and verified API key for secure script access
- Tested access to threat feed events and attribute searches

### 4.3 Graylog Integration
Graylog was deployed to view the raw and structured form of the alert before enrichment, essential for visibility, troubleshooting, and archival, but to also create alerts on enriched logs that include MISP data.

- Configured Fluent Bit to tail `alerts.json` on Wazuh Manager
- Set up TCP Raw Input on Graylog (port 5555)
- Modified `/etc/fluent-bit/fluent-bit.conf` to match Wazuh alert source
- Configured Graylog extractors to parse enriched fields

### 4.4 MISP Integration Script
MISP automates threat correlation and return MISP intelligence for further action.
- Location: `/var/ossec/integrations/custom-misp.py`
- Enhanced to support NDJSON format for batch processing (performance and compatibility improvement)
- Sends enriched output back via Wazuh socket
- Uses regex and conditionals to match Event ID types (e.g., Sysmon Event 1, 3, 22)

[Click here to view custom-misp.py employed](https://github.com/karelumair/MISP-Wazuh-Integration/blob/main/custom-misp.py)

The below Integration block added to configuration file `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` this triggers the custom-misp.py script for the select sysmon groups.
```
<integration>
  <name>custom-misp.py</name>
  <group>sysmon_event1,sysmon_event_22,syscheck</group>
  <alert_format>json</alert_format>
</integration>
```

### 4.5 Rule and Decoder Configuration
**Why:** To classify alerts enriched by MISP and assign appropriate severity levels.
- Loaded `misp.xml` with custom rules (e.g., rule ID `100622`)
- Verified integration group contains correct Sysmon events

## 5. Troubleshooting & Key Findings

### Key Troubleshooting Performed
| Issue | Why It Mattered | Resolution Attempted | Outcome |
|-------|------------------|------------------------|---------|
| MISP matches not appearing on dashboard | Alerts were being silently dropped | Validated rule 100622 | Only `iabg.de` match triggered successfully |
| Socket communication confirmed but alerts missing | Critical to confirm end-to-end message handoff | Verified `custom-misp.py` socket send format | Socket sends NDJSON; alert not indexed by Wazuh |
| Rule execution trace missing | Needed to confirm rules were parsed and matched | Enabled `ossec.conf` debug mode for the integration block | Confirmed script runs but rule match inconsistent |
| Log enrichment not parsed by Graylog | Prevented visibility of enriched IoC fields | Adjusted extractors and pipeline | Under testing |

ðŸ“· `Insert Screenshot: TCPdump or logger showing alert pushed to socket`  
ðŸ“· `Insert Screenshot: Rule debug output from ossec.log`

- [ ] Add logging/debug section to rule file to identify match failures
- [ ] Test with various endpoint scenarios (file hashes, DNS queries)
- [ ] Add Graylog alerts pipeline for auto-ticketing enrichment
